The full HLL dataset is over 100 MB and can therefore not be hosted on an online repository. Again, for data inquiries, please contact the Technical University of Dresden Institute of Cartography. A sample of the HLL data used can be found in the file HLL_Data_Sample. This data is aggregated using a spatial aggregation level of 4 as is used in the research and consists of 100 rows.
